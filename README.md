## Solution Steps
### Linting
I used code linting in this task, this what I made:
- Naming: used [camel Case style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
    - Functions Naming: should start with verb that explain it's role. 
    - Functions Body: should be 7 or 9 lines or depending on the case if it exceed should split the code to 2 functions.
- Architecture: MVVM.
- Software Development Methodologies: Agile Methodologies (SRUM Methodology)
- Version Control: Github.
    - Each commit message in this task repo contains two parts.
        - The first is Jira Task story ID.
        - The second is name of the task.

### Agile Methodology
They said that "Success comes from good planning" and after reading and understanding it, I decided to plan well for solve the task here's my solution steps in detail:
1. I used Jira Software for this task you can check the [jira project](https://marvel-app.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/backlog?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNzA2N2QzYWI1ZWY5NGQ1MmE4ZTA3NDY2YTRjZmQyZjQiLCJwIjoiaiJ9) in this task I Choosed SRUM Methodology.
2. Divide the project to stories tasks.
3. create project Backlog Stories.
